# Challenge: Greeting Card
For this challenge you will have 3 hours of class time (and no more than 4 hours total) to create a greeting card marking one of the following occassions:
- Earth Day (April 22, 2021)
- National Chocolate Chip Day (May 15, 2021)
- Global Accessibility Awareness Day (May 20, 2021)
- Memorial Day (May 31, 2021)
- Summer Solstice (June 20, 2021)

Although you do not need to turn in your process, I highly recommend doing a little research and some sketching before jumping into code. Keep these planning stages somewhat minimal though so that you can execute a solution.
